# Area-Calculator
The `calculator.py` program is designed to calculate the area of different shapes based on user input. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:



1. Menu Display: Upon execution, the program displays a menu with options for different shapes - Triangle, Rectangle, Square, Circle, and Quit.



2. User Input: The user selects a shape by entering the corresponding number.



3. Shape-specific Input: Depending on the selected shape, the program prompts the user to input the required values, such as side lengths, base, height, or radius.



4. Area Calculation: After receiving the input values, the program calculates the area of the selected shape using the appropriate formula.



5. Output: The calculated area is then displayed to the user.



6.Looping: The program returns to the main menu after completing the calculation, allowing the user to choose another shape or to quit the program.



7. Math Module Usage: For calculating the area of a circle, the program imports the math module to access the value of pi (Ï€).



This program provides a user-friendly interface for calculating the areas of different geometric shapes, making it a handy tool for students, professionals, or anyone interested in geometry.
